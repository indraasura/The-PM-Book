## Chapter - 2: The golden circle
The golden circle is an idealogy that focuses on the beliefs that drive purposes, develops systems and ultimately generates desired outcomes

Any idea, person or organization is made up of What(Outcomes/Objectives), How (Processes/Systems) and Why (Beliefs/Identities)

Mediocre and good individuals and organizations are "Outcome-oriented" or focus on the Objectives and work their way down - they build systems and processes that help them realize their outcomes and goals and often forget the *WHYs*

### Problems with an outcome-oriented approach

1. Both winners and losers have the same goals. Hence, they cannot be what differentiates them. It's the processes that they follow, and ultimately the beliefs that drive them to follow the systems they have set in place.

2. Users and customers are belief-driven. The associations that they form with values are stronger than those formed with the outcomes (which surprisingly, is the product itself)

3. Goals are useful for setting milestones and directions. It is they processes and beleifs that cause progress in that direction

##### Goals will realize themselves if the right system is followed with a strong set of beliefs. 

### How does the golden circle fit in building products
Following the inside-out flow of the golden circle, and focusing on the WHYs before the WHATs, products can be built that: 

1. Empathize and resonate with the user
2. Help in shaping a better and tighter MVP by closing in on what's really needed and what can be left out

#### Products modelled and marketted around the golden circle help take control over the law of diffusion

#### Law of diffusion
The law of diffusion is a normal distribution curve (bell curve) that distributes different types of product users

* Innovators - The first 2.5% who try every new product that they come across 

* Early adopters - The next 13.5% that "get" the product and use it because they know what it does and what it solves

* The early majority - First half of the "meat" of the curve (34%) who adopt the product 

* The late majority - Second half of the "meat" of the curve (34%) who are one step behind the early majority to convert into customers

* Laggers - The last 16% who often arrive late across your product, way past its maturity and decline 

The early majority and late majority make up for 68% of your customers and they become your customers only when the early adopters have tried and liked the product. 

These are usually the people who go for "trust-worthy" products and follow word-of-mouth or majority or both 

The golden circle shines (pun not intended) the best when it comes to roping in the early adopters who tend to buy products and try them based on their "gut feeling".

Gut feelings can be amplified and attracted by synchronizing and empathizing with the users and highlighting the beliefs behind an idea/product rather than the feature-list 

###### The golden circle is a practice, not a solution. You'll find many fundamentals and principles that use components that seem to be built around or similar to the golden circle like the five why principle or the jobs-to-be-done principle, or even design thinking which emphasises on an initial empathy with the users to identify the problem
