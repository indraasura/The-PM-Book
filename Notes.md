# Collection of Notes from various sources

### Launch - the product roadmap to success

#### Product psychology

1. PM success is directly proportional to understanding user behavior 
2. Being "user-driven" does not mean building features that users request for. "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would've said faster horses - Henry Ford" 
3. PMs should be "user informed", not "user-driven" 

##### DIY user research 

Caution: Don't let bias creep in 

1. Find people to talk to - not the ones included in the user research, but the stakeholders
2. Figure out where they spend the most of their time - their physical environment
3. Hard truths:
* You are not always the target customer 
* You do not understand everything about your customers
* Your solution is not perfect
* You may have misidentified the problem or pain-point
* You may not understand the market
* Your market may not be as big as you think 
4. Guiding questions to prepare user interview questions: 
* What are they not telling you?
* What are their fears and motivations?
* What are their frustrations?
* What are their goals?
* What does their day-to-day look like? 
* What/who are their influences?

#### Blockchain in product
Root of blockchain: 
1. Diffusion of power across society 
2. Distribution around value 

##### Smart contracts and tokens 
With smart contracts and tokens, you can set exchange rules that sort themselves out. Participation in these contracts is regulated through tokens
