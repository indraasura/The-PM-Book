## Chapter - 3: Design Thinking
Design thinking is a human-centered product process that results in solutions that cater to business success and engage customers' needs and wants by integrating customer needs, technology and business requirements, thus delivering user-centered products. 

Design thinking puts users at the center of product design and development methodologies and comprises of:

* Empathize - develops a deeper understanding of the problem
* Define - articulates the problem statement that needs to be addressed 
* Ideate - generates potential solutions which can later be combed to get the best one
* Prototype - aids in rapid testing, iterating and production of the product 
* Test - continuous short-cycle to continuously research, experiment and improve designs/products

### How does design thinking help me

Product Managers, of any kind, need to ensure quick iterations and deliver high quality products in an agile environments. These products should both excite the user as well as solve the base problem. 

Two broad classifications of features or products that are built can be: 

1. Products, features that improve an existing experience 
2. Products, features that create a new experience 

It's clear from the above two points that at the heart of products lies a "customer's experience" 

For example, Snapchat introduced a minor change in its UX which resulted in a 6.1% stock drop, a loss of 1.3 billion dollars

It is therefore, very important, for a Product Manager to:

1. Know market and customer needs
2. Put themselves in users' shoes 
3. Push beyond boundaries in order to help build something amazing :'D 

The above three points not only share a strong resemblance to the model of Design Thinking, but also overlap with the process. 

### As a "Design Thinker", you will:

1. Empathize with the customer pool and the problems that are being faced by them
and
2. Feasibility and practicability of the solutions and of the problem itself 

As Albert Einstein said "If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper queistion, I could solve the problem in less than 5 minutes" 

In conclusion, Design Thinking, when employed with other processes like 5 Whys, The Golden Circle, etc, will help identify the base problem(s) faced by customers and users, thus ensuring that brainstormed solutions originate from what really needs to be solved, rather than pushing out features that are good for exciting customers, but don't really solve the problem that needs to be solved.
